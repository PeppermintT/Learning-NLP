I am working through Natural Language textbook (https://www.nltk.org/book/). I am going to work through each chapter in turn creating a
Jupyter Notebook file for each chapter where I work through the examples to learn the concepts.

    1. Language Processing and Python
    2. Accessing Text Corpora and Lexical Resources
    3. Processing Raw Text
    4. Writing Structured Programs
    5. Categorizing and Tagging Words (minor fixes still required)
    6. Learning to Classify Text
    7. Extracting Information from Text
    8. Analyzing Sentence Structure
    9. Building Feature Based Grammars
    10. Analyzing the Meaning of Sentences (minor fixes still required)
    11. Managing Linguistic Data (minor fixes still required)
    12. Afterword: Facing the Language Challenge
