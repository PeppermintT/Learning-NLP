# Learning-NLP
I am working through Natural Language textbook (https://www.nltk.org/book/).

My plan is to work through each of the chapters - this will be one or two code files per chapter.
I will set up a Wiki page to summarise key concepts as I learn them and reflect on how I may be able to apply this to Rhubarb.

The 12 book chapters are listed below:

    1. Language Processing and Python
    2. Accessing Text Corpora and Lexical Resources
    3. Processing Raw Text
    4. Writing Structured Programs
    5. Categorizing and Tagging Words (minor fixes still required)
    6. Learning to Classify Text
    7. Extracting Information from Text
    8. Analyzing Sentence Structure
    9. Building Feature Based Grammars
    10. Analyzing the Meaning of Sentences (minor fixes still required)
    11. Managing Linguistic Data (minor fixes still required)
    12. Afterword: Facing the Language Challenge
